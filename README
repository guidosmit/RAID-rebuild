This project aims to help with rebuilding RAID5 volumes from disk images, even if all parameters were lost.
It still needs some knowledge on how to interpret analysis output and edit the volume parser.
More improvements will follow in the future, so please regard this as a Proof-of-Concept.
If you need any help in using the scripts, please drop me an email at: 0xd020@gmail.com.
